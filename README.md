# CS-300

1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

When it comes to both projects one and two for the course CS 300, the problem we were solving for were the run time for the hash table, vector sorting, and binary data structures and creating working code for one of the three data structures.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

When approaching the problem, taking in the run times of the three data structures play a huge part in which should be used for the problem in project two. The reason data structures are important to understand is because with understanding on how they work, one can choose which one to go with for whatever scenario they are in.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When it came to the activities or project, the way I overcame roadblocks is looking through the readings, while using other sources to fully understand what would be the best action for a said assignment.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

With the work I have done on this project, it expanded my knowledge on how data structures work and how run time is an important thing in designing software and developing programs.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The work I did on this project evolved my way of writing programs by making me make sure to follow the correct guidelines for coding to make it readable and maintainable. Having to use multiple functions and making sure that a viewer can clearly see what each section is designed for is important. This in turn increased my adaptability on my coding.
